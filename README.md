# Horiseon Website Refactor

## Description

This code is a refactored version of the Horiseon Website. Some of the changes performed include: 

* the addition of 'header' and 'section' tabs 
* the removal and rearrangement of unnecessary classes
* the addition of an extra 'id' to fix one of the header links
* the addition of 'alt' attributes to enhance accessibility
* Reordering elements in CSS file to follow the flow of the html code and reduce redundancy

While reading the code, pay attention to the green notes left for important changes. Trivial changes did not receive notes and CSS file changes are mentioned in the html file but not specified. The goal of this challenge was to clean up old code without modifying the look of the website.
